# 🌊 Tsunami Environment Simulation Toolkit

# ✨ Core Features
# 🌀 Environmental Awareness
Visualize interactive objects and terrain features through environmental elements with highlighted outlines.
Identify points of interest and navigation markers with custom indicators and proximity tracking.

# 🎯 Navigation Assistance
Automated directional guidance system with smooth path following and trajectory prediction.
Adjustable guidance parameters and objective selection preferences.

# ⚡ Mobility Enhancement
Alternate navigation mode enabling flexible movement in three-dimensional space (toggle-activated).
Rapid position adjustment to key locations, resource caches, or strategic vantage points.
Custom movement parameter adjustment for optimized traversal through dynamic environments.

# 🤖 Interaction Automation
Resource management protocol: Automates interaction with collectible items and interactive nodes.
Hazard response system: Automatically initiates relocation protocols when environmental threats are detected.

# 👁️ Visual Optimization
Atmospheric effect management: Reduces visual obstructions for improved situational awareness.
Contextual data display: Presents relevant environmental information and simulation metrics directly within view.

# ⚠️ Important Notice
This tool is designed for educational simulation and private environmental study only. Use exclusively in controlled virtual environments where such modifications are explicitly permitted. The developer assumes no responsibility for account management actions taken by platform administrators.

# 🛠️ Technical Details
Framework: Custom simulation interface system
Compatibility: Designed for "Escape from Tsunami" environmental simulation on the Roblox platform
Language: Lua 5.1
Dependencies: Requires a compatible execution environment for simulation scripting

# 📞 Technical Support
